# Binary Search

Find the number of occurances of a single number in a sorted list of numbers.

Additional Details:

* The numbers are between 0 and 100
* There are less than 1000000 numbers
* The numbers are stored in an array and you are given it's length

## Solution

* Perform a binary search on the array to find an occurance of the chosen number
* If the number is found, save its index
* Use exponential expansion to find the left and right bounds of the number in the array
  * Move left or right in the array, increasing movement by powers of two each move, until you find a number that isn't the target or reach the bounds of the array
  * Move left or right in the array, linearly, in the opposite direction until the target is found again

## Testing

The numbers for this problem are generated by a ruby script. Run `make generate` to generate the `numbers.txt` file and a `key.txt` file that contains the total number of elements and the occurance of each element for testing.
