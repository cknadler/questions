# Questions

Solutions to common interview programming questions.

## Format

All questions are answered in C99 and/or plain english. Every question has its own directory, a readme and, often, a makefile.

Each question should be well documented and explained. If you find something confusing, please open an issue.

## Source

All of these questions I found online. They are my own personal solutions, not copied from elsewhere. To find the exact source of a question, check the question's readme.

## Contributing

If you have a question you find interesting, open an issue and I'll try to answer it. If you have a particularly great answer to a question I have already completed, open up a pull request and I'll be more than happy to merge it.
